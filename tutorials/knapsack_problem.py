MULTIPLE KNAPSACK PROBLEM

Definition:

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of 
each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or 
equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives 
its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size 
knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.[1]

Variations:
- If only one item fits into the knapsack, the problem is an assignment problem
